Presentation for topic "Handling nervousness in presentations and streams"

## You
- People are different, some more introvert, some more extrovert.
  - Know yourself, and accept who you are!
- What will happen if you make a mistake?
  - The consequences are usually not as severe as you first thought.
  - Participants might know how it feels to do a presentation/stream.
  - Don't think too much about "What will people think about me?"!
- No one is born a master!
  - Training and repeating might help you become better.
- Know how to handle feedback!
  - Feedback is the perception of someone and might be different for different people.
  - You yourself can decide what to do with feedback.
  - Try to understand if feedback is about you or your presentation/stream/topic.

## Before the presentation/stream
- A good preparation can help to reduce nervousness.
- Create an agenda and share it!
- Think about a solution or fallback for things that may happen.
  - Have more people in the presentation/stream who might help you if you don't know an answer.
  - Plan what to do if you are waiting for a response and don't get a one. E.g. continue with the next topic.
- Maybe share responsibilities among multiple participants, e.g. multiple presenters or a moderator.
- Maybe have something to drink nearby.

## During presentation/stream
- Try to keep calm if something unexpected happens!
- Decide if the problem needs to be fixed now or is acceptable for the presentation/stream.

## After the presentation/stream
- If you want, ask for feedback!
- If you want, do a short internal feedback round.
- If necessary, take a break and try to get some distance to the topic.
- If you want, think about the presentation/stream yourself the next day.
